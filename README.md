Playing 20 Questions

The game host selects an object without revealing it to the others. The remaining players are given a category/hint as to what the object is. They must guess the object only by asking questions that can be answered with a basic "Yes" or "No". If they cannot discover the answer within 20 questions, the host is the victor.
